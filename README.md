## MOTIVATION 
* long Queues at family mart at lunchtime due to the fact that we only have one convenient shop in the school. 
* Uber and food panda can no longer deliver inside school due to covid 19 regulations hence this necessity. 
* Sometimes we waste time going to the family mart to buy products that are not even available in stock, so instead, it would be better to know what products are currently available. 
* Family mart pricing changes too often ( just in an hour or two ) so students can save money by pre-ordering the items while they are still on sale. 
* avoiding crowds and the use of cash or card interaction -- to avoid the spread of covid 19.
* create part-time jobs for students -- to pick up orders.
* Better the service --sometimes you need to use the ticketing system but you may not know how to use it, but through our app, we will be able to require this service to be done for us and simply just pick up our tickets.
